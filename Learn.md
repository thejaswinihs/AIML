**Linear Regression model**
Difference between software engineering Program abd ML program

In software program we provide the input and add the logical in the program so that we can get the desired output , However in the ML program we are providing the input(feature) and Target(label) to get the desired output where the ML will apply the algorithm to predict the output

MLflow looks as below which elaborates how the ML datasets are analysed and send the data to the ML and make use of algorthms to get the predicted output .

There are multiple algorithms in the ML , In the below example we are showing Linear Regression algoirthms

Library used to use the algoirthm to feed the training data is used based on the category
